# data_of_aircraft

## About the project:

I am living in a small city in Nebraska. The airline in our town only goes two ways: go west to Denver and go east to Chicago. And those are operated by small jets. That is fair if I am going to LA or NYC. However, if I want to go somewhere in the sourth, like Houston, I have to fly all around.
I tried so hard and convinced my wife, and then started to looking forward to get a PPL and an airplane. So that, I can fly myself or my family out.
This project is about choosing the right plane. The datasets will be used are airplane price list, airplane crash data and airplane profemance data. Those data will help me choose an airplane with the balance of cost, safty and fun.
